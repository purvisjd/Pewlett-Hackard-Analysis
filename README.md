# Pewlett Hackard Employee Retirement Analysis
##  Overview
Over the course of this particular bootcamp module, we were placed in the role of a data analyst for the fictional company, Pewlett Hackard.  The primary project that we were tasked with was creating a database of employees for the company and then identifying those employees who are becoming eligible for retirement.  Utilizing a series of SQL query statements executed on our database, we were to isolate the appropriate employees based on their age and date of hire.  It was quickly discovered just how unwieldy this level of information could be, so further analysis of the project was determined.  The general list of employees was further divided into separate departments where we could get a better idea of the total number of employees from each department as well as the specific title/role they performed.  Once the more manageable groups of data could be determined, were then tasked to two specific assignments:  determining the number of retiring emplyees per title so as to identify what roles/titles would need replacement and also identifying those employess that would be eligible to participate in the mentorship program for developing future employees.
